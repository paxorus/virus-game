# virus-game
Use arrow keys to navigate the blue virus and WASD to navigate the purple virus. To infect a cell, gain proximity and hit spacebar. While at least one cell is being infected, there is no need to hit spacebar again (since the object collision loop is already going). See what happens when a cell finally hits 0 health points.

The macrophage in the top-left does nothing. For a serious game I would use Unity and Blender.
