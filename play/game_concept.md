The year is 2015. The caribou have inherited the Earth by executing a highly skilled and premeditated coup, razing human civilzation to the ground. After thousands of failed international defense initiatives, the National Institute of Biotechnology remains the only hope. The NIB's campaign to expose the caribou to high concentrations of chemical mutagens has proved futile...but there may be hope yet.

Your department within the NIB has microfitted a highly robust RNA virus with voltage-gated locomotive mechanisms with a chip that can control its movements in fluid. Due to budget cuts and wartime attrition, your department is down to its last remote-control virus. Your job is to develop the algorithms so that through statistical machine learning software the virus can learn to associate environmental stimuli with the proper responses in test tissues extracted from fallen caribou. Then the virus can infiltrate the caribou populations and restore peace, fracking, and McDonald's. While training the virus remember: keep the algorithms short and efficient.

Gameplay: Attack the somatic cells to proliferate past the threshold for termination. Only attack the macrophages in large numbers. If a macrophage catches a virus, it'll display the antigen and all of the viruses with the same antigen are essentially screwed. Use mutagens to keep changing the antigen of your progeny.
